## About CheckPass

CheckPass is a python script that checks whether a given credential
exists among lists and collections of previously used/leaked/common credentials

## Usage

Run with -h when running for the first time :

```shell
$ python Main.py -h
```

or

```shell
$ python3 Main.py -h
```

## Notes

* This is a work-in-progress
* The script works offline.
* Collections are updated manually by one of the maintainers.
* Most collections are taken from the [SecLists project](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists).
